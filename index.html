            The notebook begins by exploring existing research and literature on the psychological benefits of music, laying the groundwork for the subsequent analysis. It then incorporates datasets encompassing student demographics, music preferences, and self-reported mental health metrics. Through a combination of descriptive statistics and data visualizations, the project seeks to identify patterns, correlations, and trends that shed light on the relationship between music consumption habits and mental health indicators.
